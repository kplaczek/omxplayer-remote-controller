# omxplayer-remote-controller
Controll your raspberry pi's omxplayer with your phone or some other gizmo because you deserves better controll over the video.


I will attempt to create a little (at least i hope so) service that will let You controll omxplayer over a phone directly from the browser. Without web server installed and written in python.
